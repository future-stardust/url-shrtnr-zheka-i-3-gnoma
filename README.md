## Design document

The [design document]({Place actual link to the design document Google Docs file here}) that
describes architecture and implementation details of this project.

### System structure

After the third laboratory assignment groups will switch projects with one another. Because of this,
all projects have to have the same high-level structure. Also, this is the reason why you should not
modify project dependencies.

Please remember that the main goal of the course is **testing** and everything else is just an 
implementation harness.

There are four modules:
- `auth` **authentication module** - creates new users, authenticates existing ones
- `bigtable` - **big table** - a key-value persistence storage (please, pay attention that you should implement it by
  yourself. It means that it is not allowed to use data bases, another key-value storages 
  implementation, etc)
- `logic` - **business logic** - logic of URL shortening
- `rest` - **REST API** - a module that provides a REST API. [Micronaut] framework is already added
  to project dependencies. It simplifies creation of REST API and provides built-in JWT 
  authentication.

## Environment prerequisites

### Java
This is a Java project, so you will need an environment with installed [JDK] 15. For installation, 
you could use:
- [sdkman] on Linux/MacOS 
- [AdoptOpenJDK] on Windows

### IDE  
As IDE use [IntelliJ Idea Edu].

### Checkstyle
We use [checkstyle] to ensure coding standards. To get real-time detection in IDE you could use [Checkstyle-IDEA] 
plugin. We use Google rules (local copy `./config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`).

## How to start development

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the project directory in IntelliJ Idea Edu
3. Configure IDE code style settings
  
    1. Open `Settings`
    2. Go to `Editor` -> `Code Style` -> `Import Scheme`
